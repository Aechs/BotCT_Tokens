# Blood on the Clocktower Tokens
Laser cut tokens for Blood on the Clocktower, A social deduction game by the Pandemonium Institute



These are the character tokens that can be made with a laser cutter/engraver with blue acrylic for good characters and red acrylic for evil ones.
Currently, Ive only made the trouble brewing character tokens (no reminder tokens included) but might add more in the future.

This project exists because I wanted to have cool versions of the role tokens for players to draw from a bag when they play the game in-person.
